# Porsche_L9110

A remote control car based off of toy motors and the L9110 DC Motor  Controller 

TBD: 'more words'

# What is this?

The goal here was to create a toy  car using some basic electronics components ( the more basic the better). 
I wanted to see if I could create it from scratch  powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico or an ESP 32.

Some of the design goals were low cost and  creating from scratch / not following any particular recipe.
I had a few of these L9110  motor controllers so I figured I'd try to use some of these and some 5 volt motors.
