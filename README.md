# Porsche_L9110

A remote control car based off of toy motors and the L9110 DC Motor  Controller.

The repository name is hopefully obviously silly.

TBD: 'more words'

# What is this?

The goal here was to create a toy  car using some basic electronics components ( the more basic the better). 
I wanted to see if I could create it from scratch  powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico or an ESP 32.

Some of the design goals were low cost and  creating from scratch / not following any particular recipe.
I had a few of these L9110  motor controllers so I figured I'd try to use some of these and some 5 volt motors.

Once the Coating in API was done I added the battery pack and took it out for a spin again not having a very high expectation of the actual motion for it


# First steps assembling the Prototype

- Got 8 popsicle sticks, glued them together and created a square out of them.  
- Took the motors and held them tight with some elastics criss crossed.
- Added the Tissue Paper Roll
   - To save time
   - Tere was not a lot of room left
   - It's a quick prototype 
- Hooked up the motor controllers to each of the motors and tucked the wires through the Tissue Paper Roll.
- Tried to understand how the wheels would be moving forward and backward.

# First Spin
Once the  API was done I added the battery pack and took it out for a spin, not having a very high expectation of great motion.
